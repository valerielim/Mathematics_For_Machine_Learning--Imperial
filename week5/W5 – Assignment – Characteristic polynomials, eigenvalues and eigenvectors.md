# Assignment â€“ Characteristic polynomials, eigenvalues and eigenvectors

For this assignment, I felt like this video is much more helpful than the lecture, maybe because it has animations? The lecture doesn't really explain how eigenvectors are calculated and skips over many steps.

Note: For question 8, the option [1, 1] should also have been selected.
